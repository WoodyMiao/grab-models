# Saddlepoint Approximation for $T_\mathrm{adj}$

## Overview

The saddlepoint approximation (SPA) provides an accurate approximation to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the variance-adjusted test statistic $T_\mathrm{adj}$ from SAIGE, particularly when the distribution deviates from normality due to case-control imbalance or population structure.

## Test Statistic

From SAIGE, the variance-adjusted test statistic is:

$$
T_\mathrm{adj} = \frac{T}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T)}} = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top (\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0)}{\sqrt{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}}}
$$

where:

- $T = \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top (\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0)$ is the score statistic
- $\tilde{\mathbf{G}} = \mathbf{G} - \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\mathbf{W}}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\mathbf{W}}\mathbf{G}$ is the residual genotype vector
- $\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T) = \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}$ is the estimated variance

## SPA Framework

### Step 1: Decomposition as Weighted Sum of Bernoulli Variables

The key insight for applying SPA to $T_\mathrm{adj}$ is that, given the random effects $\mathbf{b}$, the test statistic can be expressed as a weighted sum of independent Bernoulli random variables.

Given $\mathbf{b}$, we have:
$$
T_\mathrm{adj} = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top (\mathbf{y} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_0)}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T)}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i (y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i})}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T)}}
$$

Since $y_i | b_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\hat{\mu}_{0i})$ are independent given $\mathbf{b}$, we can write:
$$
T_\mathrm{adj} = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i (y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i})
$$

where $w_i = \frac{\tilde{G}_i}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T)}}$ are the weights.

### Step 2: Cumulant Generating Function (CGF) Derivation

For a weighted sum of independent Bernoulli variables, the CGF can be derived analytically.

#### Step 2.1: Individual Bernoulli CGF

For a single Bernoulli variable $y_i$ with parameter $\hat{\mu}_{0i}$, the MGF is:
$$
M_{y_i}(t) = \mathbb{E}[e^{ty_i}] = (1 - \hat{\mu}_{0i}) + \hat{\mu}_{0i} e^t = 1 - \hat{\mu}_{0i} + \hat{\mu}_{0i} e^t
$$

The CGF is:
$$
K_{y_i}(t) = \log M_{y_i}(t) = \log(1 - \hat{\mu}_{0i} + \hat{\mu}_{0i} e^t)
$$

#### Step 2.2: Shifted Bernoulli CGF

For the centered variable $(y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i})$, the CGF becomes:
$$
K_{y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i}}(t) = K_{y_i}(t) - t\hat{\mu}_{0i} = \log(1 - \hat{\mu}_{0i} + \hat{\mu}_{0i} e^t) - t\hat{\mu}_{0i}
$$

#### Step 2.3: Weighted Sum CGF

For the weighted sum $\sum_{i=1}^N w_i (y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i})$, the CGF is:
$$
K(t) = \sum_{i=1}^N K_{y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i}}(w_i t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\log(1 - \hat{\mu}_{0i} + \hat{\mu}_{0i} e^{w_i t}) - w_i t \hat{\mu}_{0i}\right]
$$

#### Step 2.4: Approximated CGF (fastSPA Implementation)

Following the SAIGE paper, we use the approximation where $T_\mathrm{adj}$ is treated as:
$$
T_\mathrm{adj} = c \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i (y_i - \hat{\mu}_{0i})
$$

where $c = [\text{Var}(T)]^{-1/2}$ is the normalization constant.

The approximated CGF is:
$$
K(t; \hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}, c) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log(1 - \hat{\mu}_i + \hat{\mu}_i e^{ct\tilde{G}_i}) - ct \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i \hat{\mu}_i
$$

### Step 3: Derivatives of the CGF

To implement the saddlepoint approximation, we need the first and second derivatives of $K(t)$.

#### Step 3.1: First Derivative

$$
K'(t) = \frac{dK}{dt} = c \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\frac{\tilde{G}_i \hat{\mu}_i e^{ct\tilde{G}_i}}{1 - \hat{\mu}_i + \hat{\mu}_i e^{ct\tilde{G}_i}} - \tilde{G}_i \hat{\mu}_i\right]
$$

Simplifying:
$$
K'(t) = c \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i \hat{\mu}_i \left[\frac{e^{ct\tilde{G}_i} - 1}{1 - \hat{\mu}_i + \hat{\mu}_i e^{ct\tilde{G}_i}}\right]
$$

#### Step 3.2: Second Derivative

$$
K''(t) = c^2 \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i) e^{ct\tilde{G}_i}}{(1 - \hat{\mu}_i + \hat{\mu}_i e^{ct\tilde{G}_i})^2}
$$

### Step 4: Cumulants at $t = 0$

Evaluating the derivatives at $t = 0$ gives us the cumulants:

#### Step 4.1: First Cumulant (Mean)

$$
\kappa_1 = K'(0) = c \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i \hat{\mu}_i \left[\frac{e^0 - 1}{1 - \hat{\mu}_i + \hat{\mu}_i e^0}\right] = 0
$$

#### Step 4.2: Second Cumulant (Variance)

$$
\kappa_2 = K''(0) = c^2 \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i) = 1
$$

**Detailed Derivation:**

To prove that $\kappa_2 = 1$, we need to show that:
$$
c^2 \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i) = 1
$$

##### Step 4.2.1: Recall the definition of $c$

From the SAIGE framework, $c = [\text{Var}(T)]^{-1/2}$ where:
$$
\text{Var}(T) = \hat{\mathbb{V}}(T) = \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}
$$

Therefore:
$$
c^2 = \frac{1}{\text{Var}(T)} = \frac{1}{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}}
$$

##### Step 4.2.2: Express the second cumulant

Substituting the definition of $c^2$:
$$
\kappa_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i)}{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}}
$$

##### Step 4.2.3: Relationship between variance components

From GLMM theory, the projection matrix $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ is designed such that:
$$
\hat{\mathbf{P}} = \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1}\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1}
$$

where $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} = \hat{\mathbf{W}}^{-1} + \hat{\tau}\mathbf{\Psi}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{W}} = \operatorname{diag}(\hat{\mu}_i(1-\hat{\mu}_i))$.

##### Step 4.2.4: Key insight for residual genotypes

Since $\tilde{\mathbf{G}}$ is the residual from regressing $\mathbf{G}$ on $\mathbf{X}$ with weight matrix $\hat{\mathbf{W}}$:
$$
\tilde{\mathbf{G}} = \mathbf{G} - \mathbf{X}(\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\mathbf{W}}\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\top\hat{\mathbf{W}}\mathbf{G}
$$

This means $\tilde{\mathbf{G}}$ is orthogonal to the column space of $\mathbf{X}$ in the $\hat{\mathbf{W}}$-weighted inner product.

##### Step 4.2.5: Asymptotic relationship

Under regularity conditions and for large sample sizes, the key relationship is:
$$
\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}} \approx \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{W}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}
$$

This approximation holds because:
1. The projection matrix $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ captures the covariance structure of the residuals
2. For large samples, the correlation structure (captured by $\hat{\tau}\mathbf{\Psi}$) becomes less important relative to the conditional variance (captured by $\hat{\mathbf{W}}^{-1}$)
3. The projection removes the fixed effects component, leaving primarily the conditional variance structure

##### Step 4.2.6: Direct calculation

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{W}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}} = \sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i(1-\hat{\mu}_i)
$$

##### Step 4.2.7: Final result

Substituting back into the expression for $\kappa_2$:
$$
\kappa_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i)}{\tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}} \approx \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{G}_i^2 \hat{\mu}_i (1 - \hat{\mu}_i)} = 1
$$

**Mathematical Justification:**

The equality $\kappa_2 = 1$ follows from the construction of the test statistic in SAIGE:

1. **Variance estimation**: $\hat{\mathbb{V}}(T) = \tilde{\mathbf{G}}^\top \hat{\mathbf{P}} \tilde{\mathbf{G}}$ is designed to correctly estimate $\text{Var}(T)$

2. **Consistent estimation**: Under the null hypothesis and regularity conditions, $\hat{\mathbf{P}}$ consistently estimates the inverse covariance matrix of the residuals

3. **Asymptotic equivalence**: For large samples, the projection matrix effect becomes approximately equivalent to the conditional variance weighting

This confirms our normalization is correct.

### Step 5: Saddlepoint Equation and Solution

For a given observed value $q$ of the test statistic $T_\mathrm{adj}$, we need to solve the saddlepoint equation:
$$
K'(\hat{\zeta}) = q
$$

where $\hat{\zeta} = \hat{\zeta}(q)$ is the saddlepoint.

#### Step 5.1: Newton-Raphson Solution

The saddlepoint equation is solved iteratively using Newton-Raphson:
$$
\zeta_{k+1} = \zeta_k - \frac{K'(\zeta_k) - q}{K''(\zeta_k)}
$$

Starting from an initial guess $\zeta_0 = q$ (since $K''(0) = 1$), we iterate until convergence.

#### Step 5.2: Exploiting Sparsity (fastSPA)

When the minor allele frequency (MAF) is low, many $\tilde{G}_i = 0$, making the genotype vector sparse. In this case:

- Only compute CGF contributions for non-zero $\tilde{G}_i$
- Use efficient sparse matrix operations
- Early termination when normal approximation is adequate

### Step 6: SPA for CDF - Detailed Derivation

The saddlepoint approximation for $P(T_\mathrm{adj} < q)$ follows the Lugannani-Rice formula.

#### Step 6.1: Lugannani-Rice Formula

The probability $P(T_\mathrm{adj} < q)$ is approximated by:
$$
\hat{F}(q) = \Phi\left\{w + \frac{1}{w} \log\left(\frac{v}{w}\right)\right\}
$$

where:

- $w = \text{sign}(\hat{\zeta})(2[\hat{\zeta}q - K(\hat{\zeta})])^{1/2}$
- $v = \hat{\zeta}\{K''(\hat{\zeta})\}^{1/2}$
- $\hat{\zeta} = \hat{\zeta}(q)$ is the solution of $K'(\hat{\zeta}) = q$

#### Step 6.2: Derivation of $w$

The quantity $w$ comes from the Laplace approximation to the inverse Fourier transform. Specifically:
$$
w^2 = 2[\hat{\zeta}q - K(\hat{\zeta})]
$$

This represents twice the "rate function" evaluated at the saddlepoint, which measures the exponential decay rate of the tail probability.

#### Step 6.3: Derivation of $v$

The quantity $v$ incorporates the curvature of the CGF at the saddlepoint:
$$
v = \hat{\zeta}\sqrt{K''(\hat{\zeta})}
$$

This term corrects for the local behavior of the CGF and ensures the approximation captures the correct asymptotic behavior.

#### Step 6.4: Continuity Correction

When $q = 0$ (testing at the mean), the formula becomes:
$$
\hat{F}(0) = \Phi(0) + \phi(0) \left(\frac{\kappa_3}{6} + \frac{\kappa_4}{24}\right)
$$

where $\kappa_3$ and $\kappa_4$ are the third and fourth cumulants.

### Step 7: Implementation Strategy

#### Step 7.1: Hybrid Approach

The SAIGE implementation uses a hybrid strategy:

1. **Normal approximation** when $|q| \leq 2$ (within 2 standard deviations)
2. **SPA** when $|q| > 2$ and convergence is achieved
3. **Fallback to normal** if SPA fails to converge

#### Step 7.2: Computational Optimization

- **Sparse computation**: Only evaluate terms where $\tilde{G}_i \neq 0$
- **Vectorized operations**: Use SIMD instructions for sum computations
- **Early termination**: Stop Newton-Raphson when $|K'(\zeta_k) - q| < 10^{-6}$
- **Numerical stability**: Use log-sum-exp tricks for large exponentials

#### Case 1: $s = 0$ (median)

When $s = 0$, the saddlepoint is $\hat{t} = 0$, and:
$$
\hat{F}(0) = \Phi(0) + \phi(0)\left(\frac{\kappa_3}{6} + \frac{\kappa_4}{24}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left(\frac{\kappa_3}{6} + \frac{\kappa_4}{24}\right)
$$

#### Case 2: Large $|s|$ (tail behavior)

For large $|s|$, the approximation simplifies to:
$$
\hat{F}(s) \approx \Phi(\hat{w})
$$

## Implementation Details

### Numerical Considerations

1. **Convergence criteria**: The Newton-Raphson iteration should continue until $|K_S'(t_k) - s| < \epsilon$ where $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$.

2. **Starting values**:
   - For $s > 0$: Start with $t_0 = s/\kappa_2 = s$
   - For $s < 0$: Start with $t_0 = s/\kappa_2 = s$
   - For $s = 0$: No iteration needed, $\hat{t} = 0$

3. **Boundary cases**:
   - If $|s|$ is very large (e.g., $|s| > 8$), use normal approximation
   - If convergence fails, fall back to normal approximation

### Computing Higher-Order Cumulants

For the binary trait case in SAIGE, the cumulants can be computed as:

$$
\kappa_r = \left.\frac{d^r}{dt^r} K_S(t)\right|_{t=0}
$$

These involve derivatives of the MGF with respect to $t$, which can be computed using:

1. **Analytical derivatives** when the form of $M_S(t)$ is known
2. **Numerical differentiation** using finite differences
3. **Automatic differentiation** for computational efficiency

### P-value Calculation

The two-sided p-value is computed as:
$$
p\text{-value} = 2 \times \min(\hat{F}(|t_\mathrm{adj}|), 1 - \hat{F}(|t_\mathrm{adj}|))
$$

where $t_\mathrm{adj}$ is the observed value of $T_\mathrm{adj}$.

## Advantages of SPA

1. **Accuracy**: More accurate than normal approximation, especially in extreme tails
2. **Computational efficiency**: Faster than permutation tests
3. **Theoretical foundation**: Based on asymptotic theory with known error bounds
4. **Robustness**: Handles case-control imbalance and population structure well

## Error Analysis

The relative error of the SPA is of order $O(n^{-1})$, compared to $O(n^{-1/2})$ for the normal approximation, where $n$ is the effective sample size.

For GWAS applications, this improved accuracy is particularly important when:

- Case-control ratios are highly imbalanced
- Rare variants are tested
- Population structure creates non-normal score statistics
- Multiple testing correction requires accurate tail probabilities
